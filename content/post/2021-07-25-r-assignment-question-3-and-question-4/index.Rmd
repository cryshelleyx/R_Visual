# Question 4 

1. around 3am some employees were traveling on same routes near the supposed executives houses (Ada Campo-Corrente, Orhan Strum, Willem Vasco-Pais and Ingrid Barranco) including: Loreto Bodrogi (car15), Isia Vann (car16), Hennie Osvaldo (car21) and Minke Mies (car24) on 7th, 9th and 14th.

These security personnels do not have much interactions other than the midnight events. Perhaps they were monitoring the executives' night movements.


```{r, include=FALSE}
car_cc <- read_excel('MC2\\car_cc.xlsx')

car_assign <- left_join(car_assign, car_cc, 
                        by = c('CarID' = 'id'))
car_assign$cc <- as_factor(car_assign$cc)
df1 <- left_join(df1, car_assign,
                 by = c("last4ccnum" = "cc"))

```




```{r, , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

                   coords = c("long", "lat"),
                   crs = 4326)

gps_path_selected <- gps_sf %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  filter(period == c("midnight"))

tm_shape(ap) +
  tm_rgb(ap, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
         alpha = NA,
         saturation = 1,
         interpolate = TRUE,
         max.value = 255) + 
  tm_shape(gps_path_selected) +
  tm_dots(col = 'id', size = 0.05)

```

2. Playing Golf 
executive meeting at golf on 12th by car id 4, 10, 35 - Ingrid Barranco, Ada Campo-Corrente, Willem Vasco-Pais.

```{r,echo=FALSE , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

gps_path_selected <- gps_sf %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  filter(day == "12") 

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(ap) +

         alpha = NA,
         saturation = 1,
         interpolate = TRUE,
         max.value = 255) + 
  tm_shape(gps_path_selected) +
  tm_dots(col = 'id', size = 0.05)
```


3. CEO Welcome Party 

car ID 31 -Sten Sanjorge, the CEO only joined them on 19th. 

Everyone spent over 100 dollars on 19th. 


```{r,echo=FALSE , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
golf <- df1[c("timestamp", "FirstName", "LastName", "location", "price")] %>%
  filter(location == "Desafio Golf Course")
  
mutate(golf, timestamp = format(timestamp,"%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S")) %>%
         datatable(rownames=TRUE, filter="top", class = 'cell-border stripe')


```


4. Hotel Meetup during lunch hours 

Elsa Orilla and Brand Tempestad visited hotel during midday during lunch hours on 8th, 10th, 14th and 17th. They paid their bills separately. 


```{r,echo=FALSE , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

hotel<- df1%>% filter(location == "Chostus Hotel")
hotel <- hotel[c("timestamp", "last4ccnum", "LastName", "FirstName", "CurrentEmploymentType","CurrentEmploymentTitle", "price")] 

mutate(hotel, 
       timestamp = format(timestamp,"%d/%m/%Y, %H:%M:%S")) %>%
         datatable(rownames=TRUE, filter="top", class = 'cell-border stripe')

```


# question 5 

1. Overall, only very few fueling activities detected.

For Car ID 1, which is drove by Nils Calixto. The very few transactions at at Autosupply and U-Pump and Daily Dealz were on his records. 

On 13th, he stayed at Hippokampos until 135pm. However, there was a transaction record at 118pm at U-Pump. Without driving a car, it is suspicious why there was a transcation done at place far from the eatery.

2. Various security persons vistied Kronos Capital on 18th at different time intervals. Adra Nubarron stayed at Kronos Capital for almost 24 hours.

```{r,echo=FALSE , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gps_sf <- st_as_sf(gps,
                   coords = c("long", "lat"),
                   crs = 4326)
gps_path_selected <- gps_sf %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  filter(day == "18")

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(ap) +
  tm_rgb(ap, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
         alpha = NA,
         saturation = 1,
         interpolate = TRUE,
         max.value = 255) + 
  tm_shape(gps_path_selected) +
  tm_dots(col = 'id', size = 0.05)


```

3. Unknown place 

Security People repeatedly visited an unknown place near Bean there around 1120am on 17th, 9th, 8th.

```{r,echo=FALSE , message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
gps_sf <- st_as_sf(gps,
                   coords = c("long", "lat"),
                   crs = 4326)
gps_path_selected <- gps_sf %>%
  st_as_sf() %>%
  filter(id== c("15", "24","21"))

tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(ap) +
  tm_rgb(ap, r = 1, g = 2, b = 3,
         alpha = NA,
         saturation = 1,
         interpolate = TRUE,
         max.value = 255) + 
  tm_shape(gps_path_selected) +
  tm_dots(col = 'id', size = 0.05)


```
